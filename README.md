# Kickstarting with Microsoft Excel
Performing analysis on "Kickstarter" dataset to uncover trends.

## The Overview
We needed to help a person named Louise, who was interested in comparing her fundraising campaign to that of other people. Then we were given a data set, and are now tasked to  find under what conditions the fundraising goals were most likely to be met. One aspect I explored was figuring out what months were most ideal to try and fundraise in. Another premise that I was looking into was the outcome of fundraising based on the goal they initially set. To perform these calculations, the use of pivot tables and pivot graphs were necessary to solve this case.

### Purpose
The overall purpose of this assignment was to determine and predict how Louise's play "Fever" compared in its fundraising goal in respect to different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. To determine the overall results, creating pivot charts and tables were the key parts on understanding it all.

## The Analysis and Challenges
The biggest challenge I had during this assignment was trying to determine what varaibles that I have typed wrong on Deliverabale 2 and it took me quite a while to figure it out, experimenting on what I did wrong and I have finally came to a conclusion that I have essentially selected a wrong column in the Kickstarter sheet, instead of column D I have picked column E and I needed to change the codes for the three columns in order to fix it. Eventually I was able to fix it. Another point was to understand on how target amount and month of fundraising impacted on how successful the campaign would be, I had to use pivot tables. Pivot tables were the essentials to this challenge, because they allowed me to pull and altar certain types of data and create efficient charts.

### The Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the given data set, I created a pivot table to inspect when various fundraising campaigns have kicked off. When I graphed the results and found the percentage of success for the listed months, the results were clear. According to the data, the earlier months such as "May", "June", and "July" had a much higher chance to reach their goal than in the later months like "November", "December" and "January". In conclusion, during the earlier months of the year from spring to summer, most of these people tend to give more during those times. Another possibility for these people not spending that much in the later months would probably because of "Black Friday"and purchasing gifts for "Christmas".

### The Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Using a line chart, we could see that in general, the higher the goal was set, the more likely the campaign was to inevitably fail. However, there was an anomally in the data which segmented this trend between a target of around $30,000 to $40,000 where somehow people managed to hit their goal more often, than the data immediately surrounding them. Those who had a fundraising goal of less than $5,000 had actually hit their goal and around 70% of the time or more. Although, those who set a goal to fundraise for $45,000 or more had over an 80% chance to not hit their goal. Generally speaking, the higher the fundraising target was set the less likely it would achieve it's goal in time.

### The Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Typing in typos was my main general challenge throughout the challenge and miscliking things that causes the varaibles to go wrong. Last thing would be re-learning the module itself since I have missed a class session before and I was about an hour late to another one. 


## Results / Conclusion
Question #1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- Launching a sucessful campaign requires you to choose spefic dates in order to achieve the goal. Given the date, the months of "May" and "June" had the highest chance of meeting their fundraising goal, meanwhile months like November, December, and January, all have a much lower chance of meeting their goal.
- The earlier months that are close to spring and summer, like May, June, and July all seem to have higher chances for success rates on meeting their funraising goal. One thing I do notice in the dataset, is that the number of data points during these months is much higher too (more events go on during these months). I wonder if the lack of data outside of the summer months can skew the data slightly.

Question #2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- I concluded that companies that were aiming for over $45,000 or more in the fundraising campaign had much lower chance of meeting their goal than those with goals of less than amount.

Question #3. What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Due to the dataset including in the outliers for our data, we didn't finish with a cleaner final result with no outliers. Another limitation were the target goal numberes being too high resulting in less data. Lastly, the data among all the fields were not equal in terms of the number of runs we had in each column.

Question #4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- An idea that we could done was the addition of a Box and Whiskers Plot. The use of this visualization would have helped us identify the outliers, hence would have given us a better look at the whole picture.
